## Concept

Notable Wiener is notable for trying to combine Sonic Unleashed with 
Devil May Cry 5/Metal Gear Rising Revengeance. It would be even more 
notable if it succeeded.

By default, the control scheme is meant to support momentum based,
high speed platforming, with an emphasis on quick reaction times
and shortcuts.

The player can press and hold RB to lock onto enemies and objects, 
changing the control scheme to something more suited to a character 
action game.

## Binds

Left Stick - Walk (Speeds up into a sprint over time.)

A - Jump (Double Jump is unlockable.)
B - this might be a grab / devil buster type deal later idk
X - Shoulder Tackle / Dive > Recover (More effective at high speeds.)
Y - Slide / Stomp (Carries momentum and reduces friction.) > Drift (Left Stick) (Subject to removal)

RB - Lock On (Devil May Cry)
RT - Boost (Consumes 1 Break Store)

LB - Shoot (Subject to possible alteration)
LT - Break Cancel (Consumes 1 Break Store, immediately interupts current action)

## Binds (Locked On)

Left Stick - Strafe Target (Constant Speed)

A - Jump / Roll (Left Stick L/R)
B - I still don't know tbh
X - Blow Attacks
Y - Kick Attacks

## Example Gameplay Scenario

Player runs forward on a track and is given a branching pathway. Run along a wall to skip the enemies on the main path
by dashing into the wall at a high speed. The player takes this opportunity, and runs into a room full of enemies, that
is locked behind a completion gate. 6 6
