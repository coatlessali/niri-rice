So uh, small rant.

R2ModMan and it's consequences have been a disaster for ULTRAKILL modders.

In case you're unaware r2modman is a GUI for managing mods in various Unity games, 
such as Risk of Rain 2 and ULTRAKILL. On the surface, it's a neat little tool that
makes modding these games much more accessible, and makes managing your mods easier.

It is unforunate then, that I must say it creates more confusion and problems than
it helps to solve.
